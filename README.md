# UC Berkeley Coding Challenges

### My Solutions:

[**Luhn Algorithm**](https://github.com/ZoeBKramer/berkeley-challenges/blob/master/lib/luhn.rb) - The Luhn algorithm is a method that credit cards and other identification numbers can use to distinguish valid numbers from invalid ones. It is meant to prevent users from making accidental errors.

[**Fibonacci Sequence**](https://github.com/ZoeBKramer/berkeley-challenges/blob/master/lib/fibonacci.rb) - In this challenge exercise, I wrote a program to generate the Fibonacci sequence. I implemented the code two ways: with and without recursion. I used benchmarking tools to see which implementation is more efficient.
