# UC Berkeley Coding Challenges

### My Solutions:

[**Luhn Algorithm**](https://github.com/ZoeBKramer/berkeley-challenges/blob/master/lib/luhn.rb) - The Luhn algorithm is a method that credit cards and other identification numbers can use to distinguish valid numbers from invalid ones. It is meant to prevent users from making accidental errors.

[**Fibonacci Sequence**](https://github.com/ZoeBKramer/berkeley-challenges/blob/master/lib/fibonacci.rb) - In this challenge exercise, I wrote a program to generate the Fibonacci sequence. I implemented the code two ways: with and without recursion. I used benchmarking tools to see which implementation is more efficient.

[**Collatz Sequence**](https://github.com/ZoeBKramer/berkeley-challenges/blob/master/lib/collatz.rb) - Given an input of n, the next number in is defined by:

* n is even: n/2
* n is odd: 3n + 1

I wrote a method to determine a number's Collatz sequence as well as created a method to find the number between 1 and 1,000,000 with the longest Collatz sequence.
